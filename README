something like runkeeper, but use runmaker as an input
open interface, api, storage to allow easy expansion
demo program for fun and experimentation with heroku and rails


initial ideas:

set up runmaker to email to runner and track the run info

runner will:
  save the run data
  update a calendar
  total the info by week/month, etc
  track shoes

some sort of interface with twitter might be nice

save the data in S3 with weekly copies someplace
