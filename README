something like runkeeper, but use runmeter as an input
open interface, api, storage to allow easy expansion
demo program for fun and experimentation with heroku and rails


initial ideas:

set up runmeter to email to runner and track the run info

runner will:
  save the run data
  update a calendar
  total the info by week/month, etc
  track shoes

some sort of interface with twitter might be nice

save the data in S3 with weekly copies someplace

-- more notes -- July 3, 2011
  collect and track the gps xml files from runmeter iphone app

  do overlays on maps showing which trails are left to run

  some sort of clickable layers or something would be good

  * future *  iphone app which knows the routes and alerts about upcoming turns and trailheads
